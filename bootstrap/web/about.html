            Sanvedan started as a training firm on 1st May 2012. When our
            founder Sameer Dighe was graduating from psychology department of
            Ruia college. Our objective is to change the mindset of the people
            in our country towards psychological well being and financial
            planning. We believe that we have got only political independence
            from Britishers but psychologically our Indian people are in the
            same colonial mentalities. We are from the collectively Asian
            culture but we lack in we feeling for our Nation.
