      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Sanvedan started as a training firm on 1st May 2012. When our founder
        Sameer Dighe was graduating from psychology department of Ruia college.
        Our objective is to change the mindset of the people in our country
        towards psychological well being and financial planning. We believe that
        we have got only political independence from Britishers but
        psychologically our Indian people are in the same colonial mentalities.
        We are from the collectively Asian culture but we lack in we feeling for
        our Nation.
